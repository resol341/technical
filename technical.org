* Mouse breeding
Here are a few recommendations to help combat a colonies potential breeding depression:

1)      Set additional pairs of breeders in the fall (ideally September or October) – this will help offset the potential reduced production from existing breeders.  Even setting them now (in November) can help.  Ideally, throughout the year, you should be rotating breeders so that you always have pairs that are being set up, are at the highest level of production and others that are getting ready to retire so that you are not retiring or starting all of your breeders at the same time.
2)      Make sure that females are not bred until they are between 6-8 weeks of age and males until 8 weeks of age.  Plan to retire breeders after about 6 months of active breeding, but make sure that you have a new pair that is producing before you retire your old breeders.
3)      Give your breeders brown paper shred (ask your care tech for some).  This has been shown to help mice build a better, warmer nest for their pups.  Huts are generally not recommended.  The thought is that the female fends off the male from inside a hut thus delaying or stopping breeding.
4)      Cages should be low on a rack where it’s darkest and there is less traffic.
5)      Avoiding handling breeding cages as much as possible. Manipulating/handling the cage (even if only to check for the presence of a litter) adds additional stress to those animals and can affect breeding productivity.
6)      If possible, don’t mix your breeders and experimental cages on the same rack.  The disruption of moving the experimental cages can adversely affect the breeders.  Ideally, breeding cages should only be moved when regular cage changing occurs every two weeks.
7)      Place breeders on racks as far away as possible from doors, ATS’s, equipment, noise, etc.  Subtle vibrations can cause stress with mice and effect breeding behavior.  There is also additional traffic in those areas.
8)      Remove male mice for the weekend and replace them on Monday.  A brief separation can make the heart grow fonder.
9)      Taking the feces from a different male and placing into the breeding cage can often entice the male to breed due to their competitive nature.
10)   Swapping males between cages.  If they aren’t performing in the current environment, maybe a new one will help.
11)   Set triad breeders.  Two females and one male will often produce better results.  Just make sure to keep a close eye on them.  The male will need to be removed if a female drops a litter.
12)   Finally, contact the Breeder Core for assistance.  We give free consultations, we can manage your breeding for you or help on a special request basis.

* Tissue digestion for AO and CA
Solutions
Digestion solution: 3.2mg/ml collagenase II, 0.75mg/ml elastase (Worthington), 0.2mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (sigma) in Hank's buffered saline solution (HBSS), pH7.5. Serile filer with 0.2um syringe filter.
FA buffer: 0.1% FCS in 1X PBS, sterile filer with .2um syringe filter.
FA3 buffer (sorting buffer): 1x PBS (Ca/Mg++ free), 1mM EDTA, 25mM HEPES pH 7.0, 1% FBS or BSA (For 50ml solution: 5ml 10X PBS, 100ul 0.5M EDTA, 1.25ml 1M HEPES, 500ul FBS), sterile filer with 0.2um syringe filter.

Procedure:
If doing matrigel, thaw aliquots on ice in fridge in the morning.
Isolate aortas, carotid arteries from mouse. Wash the artery with HBSS once to remove serum from the medium.
Tissues are minced with blade and transferred to digestion solution (tissue from 1 mouse need about 1ml) and incubate at 37oC in the incubator for 1 hr (do not exceed 1.5hr). Pipet mix every 10 min.
Wash once with FA buffer (centrifugation: 1100 RPM, 12 min, 4oC, take care to remove all the fatty tissues at the surface of the supernatant).
Pass the single cell suspensions through a 70um filter, pellet the cells again at the same setting.
Antibody incubation: resuspend the cells in 100ul of FA buffer , add 3ul of Sca1APC antibody, and incubate on ice for 1 hour (minimum 45min).
If doing matrigel injection, freeze some P1000 tips and Eppendorf tubes in -20.
Spin down the cells and resuspend in 1ml of FA3 buffer.
DAPI is used for staining cells (add right before sorting at flow core).
Flow cytometry core is on the 4th floor, RC1 south.

Heparin 30IU/ml (stock 20kU/ml, sigmaH3393, 666.666X, for 700ul matrigel need 1.05ul)
VEGF 100ng/ml  (stock 50 µg/mL  in PBS R&D systems 493-MV/CF, 500x, for 700ul matrigel need 1.4ul)
FGF2 500ng/ml (stock 100 μg/mL in PBS R&D systems 3139-FB-025/CF, 200x, for 700ul matrigel need 3.5ul)
Note VEGF and FGF2 are ordered carrier free (BSA free) to prevent immune reaction from the host.

** Mouse Pre-treatments
   One hour prior to tissue harvest, mice were IP injected heparin
   (1,000 units/ml, 200ul per mouse)
** Prepare the equipment (use 27 G needle)
   1. 20 mL EDTA buffer, 10 mL perfusion buffer, 50 mL Collagenase Buffer in
      Syringes, keep the collagenase buffer warm with heatpad
   2. Prepare 3 60mm dishes with 10 mL of each buffer
** Tissue harvest
   Induce and maintain anaesthesia with isoflurane
   Open chest and expose heart
   Move left lung and Cut inferior vena cava and decending AO
   Perfuse from right ventricle with 7 ml of EDTA buffer in 1 min
   Clamp Aorta with hemostat and cut to extract heart
   Proceed to tissue digestion in a 10cm dish with EDTA buffer
** Tissue digest
   1. Perfuse from the left ventricle with EDTA buffer (10mL in 6 min).
      Apply only enough pressure to the syringe to keep the heart fully
      inflated. Move heart to perfusion buffer
   2. Using the same perforation, perfuse the heart with 3 ml
      Perfusion buffer to clear out EDTA. Transfer heart to plate with digestion
      Buffer
   3. Perfuse with eyzyme digest cocktail (apply minimum pressure needed to
      keep heart full inflated, ~2 ml/min)
      Full digestion can be achieve with 25 mL to 60 mL depending on the
      condition of tissue/mouse. "Signs of complete digestion include a
      noticeable reduction in resistance to injection pressure, loss of shape
      and rigidity, holes and/or extensive pale and fluffy appearance at the
      heart surface, and ejection of myocytes into the effluent buffer, which
      are just visible to the naked eye."
   4. Remove clamp. Physically dissociate cardiac tissue in a new 10cm dish with
      5 mL volume trituration with a 1000 µL pipette(cut tip).
   5. Bring the volume up to 15 mL with stop buffer
   6. Pass the cell suspension through a 250 µM mesh filter
   7. Centrifuge at 50 g for 1min, remove supernatant and repeat 3 times
   8. Collect supernatant, and pass through 70 um filter.
      Centrifuge supernatant at 400 g for 5 minutes to pellet non-myocytes
      non-myocytes will be subject to antibody labeling.
   9. Combine the CM pellets and resuspend in 5 mL of Perfusion buffer three
      rounds of sequential gravity settling for 10 min. Combine pellet
